# Interview Questions
Here is a small set of interview questions to assess your technical ability, thought processes, and data science and analytical awareness.  Feel free to use whatever resources you need to answer theses questions (textbooks, articles, programming langugages, and packages) answers don't need to be perfect or complete, be prepared to describe your process and sources.

1. Present three differences and three similarities between business analytics & business intelligence and industrial applications of data science (e.g., data science and machine learning for IoT).  Choose one application to explain (does not have to be a Schneider Electric specific, any industrial application of data science will be good).

2. Analyze the time-series data in `power-data.csv`.  What can you tell me about:
  - Means, variations and trends of each time series
  - Relationships between the time serieses
  - If I told you that RPDUs are each connected to one of the PDUs, how could you use the time-series data to diagnose those relationships?

If possible, prepare your work in a reproducible format (like an R or Jupyter notebook) with comments and notes, so we can discuss your process and choice of tools, packages, and methods.
