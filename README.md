# Interview Questions
Here is a small set of interview questions for the Data Scientist position to assess your technical ability, thought processes, and data science and analytical awareness.  Feel free to use whatever resources you need to answer the questions (textbooks, articles, programming langugages, and packages) -- as open-book as possible.  While your answers don't need to be perfect, be prepared to describe your process and sources.

1. Present two differences and two similarities between business analytics and business intelligence and industrial applications of data science (i.e., for IoT).  Choose one application to explain (does not have to be a Schneider Electric specific, any industrial application of data science will be good).

2. Analyze the time-series data in `power-data.csv`.  What can you tell me about:
  - Variations and trends of each time series
  - Relationships between the time series
  - If I told you that RPDUs are each connected to one of the PDUs, how could you use the time-series data to diagnose those relationships?
If possible, share your work in a reproducible format (like an R or Jupyter notebook) so we can discuss your process and choice of tools, packages, and methods.
