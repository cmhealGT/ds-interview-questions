# Interview Questions
Here are three interview questions to assess your technical ability, thought processes, and data science and analytical awareness.  Feel free to use whatever resources you need to answer theses questions (textbooks, articles, programming langugages, and packages). You answers don't need to be perfect or 100% complete, but you should be prepared to describe your process and sources.

## 1. Compare and contrast business and industrial analytics 
Please prepare a discussion of three differences and three similarities between business analytics & business intelligence and industrial applications of data science and machine learning.  Choose an industrial/IoT application to highlight these characteristics (does not have to be a Schneider Electric specific example).

## 2. Analyze the time-series data in `power-data.csv`.  
Tell me what you can about:
  - Means, variations and trends of each time series
  - Relationships between the time serieses
  - If I told you that RPDUs are each connected to one of the PDUs, how could you use the time-series data to diagnose those relationships?
If possible, prepare your work in a reproducible format (like an R or Jupyter notebook) with comments and notes, so we can discuss your process and choice of tools, packages, and methods.

## 3. Evaluating methods
We will encounter many different methods for data science: signal processing, anomaly detection, forecasting, classification, neural networks, Bayesian networks, etc.  There is rarely one "optimal" solution to a customer or business application.  What some of the approaches and metrics you would use to compare and evaluate methods?
